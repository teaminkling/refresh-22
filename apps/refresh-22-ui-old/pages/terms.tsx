          attempts to abide by local laws in North America and the European Union.

          By accessing this website and using any of our products and services, you agree to be
          bound by our Terms of Use, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are
          responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws of which we may not be aware.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The materials contained in this website and other products and services are protected by

          License
        </SubHeader>

        <Paragraph>
          Permission is granted to temporarily download content on this website for personal
          non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is a grant of a license, not a transfer of
          title, and under this license you may:
        </Paragraph>

        <UnorderedList>
          <li>
            Not copy/modify the materials publicly. You may copy/modify assets (e.g., marketing art
            assets), but you must not post them anywhere online.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not attempt to decompile or reverse-engineer any software owned by the development
            company, Inkling Interactive, without divulging findings to Inkling Interactive
            engineers within 24 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not remove any copyright or proprietary notations from the materials.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not &quot;permalink&quot; to static web content including (but not limited to) images,
            audio files, and videos.
          </li>
        </UnorderedList>

        <Paragraph>
          The license to use this website is immediately revoked upon violation of these
          restrictions and may be terminated by the Inkling Interactive or FiveClawD teams at any
          time. Upon termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your
          possession whether in electronic or printed format.
        </Paragraph>

        <SubHeader>
          &quot;Permalinking&quot;
        </SubHeader>

        <Paragraph>
          Permalinking is the act of directly linking to image, video, audio files (not the URL
          including the title, author, and description), or other media on social media or any other
          website and it is strictly disallowed here.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          However, Inkling Interactive provides a provisional license to permalink using chat
          applications when media is to be consumed in a transitory form. If you are in doubt, just
          link to the blog post/submission containing the work to which you want to link.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Again, to be clear: if it does not end in a file extension
          like <code>.png</code>, <code>.mp3</code> etc., then it is <b>okay to link</b>.
        </Paragraph>

        <SubHeader>
          Intellectual Property
        </SubHeader>

        <Paragraph>
          FiveClawD and Inkling Interactive take intellectual property (IP) extremely seriously.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The Design Refresh respects international IP law. Content and media on this website is
          owned by their original copyright holders and hosted on this web site.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Due diligence has been exercised to ensure sufficient attribution and permission to use
          and showcase IP. Posting works to the site via the upload form, for instance, is used as
          implicit permission to post work on this website. However, full rights remain to the
          original IP holder: we just hold the rights to host it to be displayed in our application
          and on our servers.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          We will respect the wishes of IP holders present and future. Please contact Inkling
          Interactive at any time via Discord or email with the subject line “Intellectual
          Property”,
          and we’ll get right on that.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Also, Inkling Interactive takes great effort to ensure we are complying with international
          Intellectual Property (IP) law. We make frequent use of Open Source Software (OSS),
          abiding by licenses as required.
